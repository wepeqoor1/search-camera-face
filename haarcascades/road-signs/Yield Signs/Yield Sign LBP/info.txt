NEW NEGATIVE IMAGES!!!!
False Positives used to generate negative images

Notes: 
Negative images consist of landscapes and cityscapes/streets as well as some images of people and sings

--> Seems to work better than the HAAR cascade trained with the same parameters, fewer false positives <--
