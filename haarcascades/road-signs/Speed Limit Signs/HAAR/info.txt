Uses false positive negative images from sign trainings

Notes: 
High stage versions don't seem to pick up on targets that well.
Lower stages identify stoplights but tend to identify multiple ones in a single stoplight.
May try training a classifier for each color of stoplight.....
Could also try lowering minHitRate
From testing the classifier on that image with many signs in it it seems that the classifer looks for 
light/dark regions surrounded by dark/light regions. Probably due to stoplights having a bright light duh.

However, the 17 stage version can pick up the stoplight sign while discriminating against most other signs.
It gets tricked by the letter E

Stage 16 seems to work the best. It identifies the most traffic lights with the fewest false positives
